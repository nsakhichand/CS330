Software Design Approach

How do I approach designing software?
- Understand Requirements: Start by clearly defining what the software needs to do. This involves gathering requirements from stakeholders, users, or through analysis of the problem domain.
- Architecture Design: Decide on the overall structure of the software. This might involve choosing between monolithic, microservices, or layered architectures depending on the project's scale and needs.
- Modularization: Break down the software into modules or components. Each module should have a single responsibility, enhancing maintainability and testability.
- Design Patterns: Utilize established design patterns where applicable to solve common design problems efficiently.
- Prototyping: Create prototypes to visualize and refine the design before full implementation.
- Documentation: Document your design decisions and architecture to guide future developers or for maintenance.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
- Object-Oriented Design: Enhanced understanding of how to structure classes and objects for better interaction and inheritance.
- UML Diagramming: Improved skills in creating Use Case, Class, Sequence, and Activity diagrams to visualize system design.
- Design for Scalability: Learning to anticipate future growth and designing systems that can scale efficiently.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
- Agile Methodology: Used iterative cycles (sprints) where design, development, and testing are continuously refined.
- Design Thinking: Employed empathy, definition, ideation, prototyping, and testing phases to ensure user-centric design.
- Review and Feedback: Regular design reviews with peers or mentors to refine and validate design choices.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
- Iterative Refinement: Applying the agile approach to continuously improve design based on feedback and changing requirements.
- User-Centric Design: Incorporating design thinking to ensure solutions meet real user needs, which is crucial in UX/UI design or product development.
- Documentation: Keeping thorough documentation for future scalability or handover of projects.

Program Development Approach

How do I approach developing programs?
- Plan: Outline the program's logic and flow before coding. Use flowcharts or pseudocode.
- Code in Phases: Develop in small, manageable pieces, testing each part as you go.
- Test-Driven Development (TDD): Write tests before or alongside code to ensure functionality.
- Refactoring: Regularly refactor code to improve efficiency, readability, and maintainability.
- Version Control: Use systems like Git to manage code changes and collaborate effectively.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- Scene Graph Management: Learned to manage complex hierarchies in 3D scenes using object-oriented techniques.
- Shader Programming: Gained experience with writing shaders for real-time rendering effects.
- Optimization Techniques: Implemented techniques like level of detail (LOD) or frustum culling to enhance performance.

How did iteration factor into your development?
- Incremental Development: Each feature was added and refined in iterations, allowing for feedback and adjustments.
- Bug Fixes: Iterative testing led to identifying and fixing bugs in stages rather than all at once at the end.
- Performance Tuning: Continuous profiling and optimization were performed throughout the development to ensure efficiency.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
- From Linear to Modular: Initially, coding might have been linear; over time, a shift towards modular and reusable code was adopted.
- Increased Use of Libraries: As familiarity grew, more external libraries were integrated to handle complex functionalities efficiently.
- Enhanced Debugging: Improved debugging techniques, from simple print statements to sophisticated debugging tools.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
- Mathematical Concepts: Deepens understanding of linear algebra, calculus, and geometry, which are crucial in advanced studies.
- Visual Learning: Enhances ability to visualize abstract concepts, useful in fields like physics, engineering, or even biology.
- Interdisciplinary Projects: Prepares for projects that require integration of computer science with other disciplines like art or architecture.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
- Simulation and Modeling: Useful in industries like automotive, aerospace, or gaming for creating realistic simulations.
